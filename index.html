            <h2>Sydney Harbour Bridge</h2>
            <p>Spanning the city center to the North Shore, the Sydney Harbour Bridge is a wide steel arch bridge known
                for its beauty as well as function, providing a crossing for cars, trains, bikes and pedestrians. While
                the more daring can do the BridgeClimb to the top of the structure, opened to traffic in 1932, anyone
                can enjoy a walk for free.</p>

            <p>Located in the heart of Sydney Harbour, a short ferry ride from the CBD, Cockatoo Island is a
                historically significant place where visitors can explore historic landmarks and stay overnight. Known
                as ‘Wareahmah’ by the region’s Aboriginal People, the island – a former convict penal establishment and
                ship dockyard – has emerged as a popular arts and entertainment venue, having hosted everything from
                Australia’s largest visual arts event, the Biennale of Sydney, through to live performances by musicians
                Lorde and Justin Bieber.</p>
